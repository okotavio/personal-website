            During the 1970s, graphic designers were raiding style books and
            publications of earlier generations looking for more funky stylings,
            and found a treasure trove in the “Old Style” types from earlier in
            the century. The irreverence and friendliness of these typefaces was
            the perfect countercultural antidote to the perceived stuffiness and
            chilly efficiency of traditional text faces. A prime example of this
            style coming out of the ’70s was Ed Benguiat’s swashy version of
            Bookman for ITC. Benguiat’s type was an ode to Oswald Cooper’s
            Cooper Black Italic and is known to most people as the friendly,
            “Thank You For Shopping With Us” (a typographical “wave” of
            appreciation) that graces grocery bags all over North America.
