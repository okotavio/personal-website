QuintoAndar is a Brazilian startup that provides a digital marketplace that connects tenants and homebuyers to landlords and sellers.

In 2019, professional home inspections costs were increasing the companyâ€™s cost-to-serve at a time when the company wanted to improve their unit economics.

Working as a Product Designer at the Scalability team, my goal was to design a solution to allow tenants to be able to inspect their new homes without the help of a professional inspector.

## Process

I decided to start my discovery with three steps which included qualitative research with tenants, inspectors and a workshop with stakeholders:

- In-depth interviews: scripted, 30-minute calls with 10 tenants who had recently moved in.

- Contextual inquiries: observing and interviewing three professional inspectors while they inspected real properties.

- Experts workshops: a series of workshops to gather information from stakeholders and operational teams through a Convictions, Assumptions and Questions framework.

These steps allowed my team and I to understand:

1. What was a professional inspector's mental model while inspecting a property so as to bring a similar model for tenants.

2. What were tenants' pain points with the move-in inspection and how we could empower them with a self-service application.

## Ideation and prototyping

After I gathered enough information on inspections, I kicked off the solution with an ideation workshop so as to bring other product designers and make it a collaborative process.

This allowed me to quickly have a few ideas to prototype a solution, bring it to a design critique and test it with users within a week and a half. At the end, my process involved the following steps:

1. Design jam: a 2-hour workshop with 7 product designers going through How Might We, Crazy 8s and other ideation exercises.

2. Design critique: a 1-hour critique session to gather feedback from other product designers on design system usage, writing and accessibility.

3. Usability testing: a task-based usability test with 5 recruited users to test our solution out.

## Delivery

After iterating multiple times on the prototype with user and stakeholders feedback, the solution was an easy-to-use, comprehensive inspection tool tailored for the context and needs of a tenant who just moved in to a new home.
